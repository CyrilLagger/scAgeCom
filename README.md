# scAgeCom 

This repository contains the scripts used to produce the data related to scAgeCom,
our "Murine Atlas of Age-related Changes in Intercellular Communication" (
manuscript in preparation)

Data are produced by combining our R package
[scDiffCom]("https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scDiffCom")
with scRNA-seq data publicly available from the
[Tabula Muris Senis consortium](https://tabula-muris-senis.ds.czbiohub.org/)
and the
[Murine aging cell atlas](https://mca.research.calicolabs.com/).

These data are then displayed on our Shiny App
[scAgeComShiny](https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scAgeComShiny).
