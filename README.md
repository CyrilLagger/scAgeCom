# scAgeCom 

This repository contains the scripts used to produce the data of scAgeCom,
our "Murine Atlas of Age-related Changes in Intercellular Communication" 
([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.456238v1)).

Data are produced by combining our R package
[scDiffCom](https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scDiffCom)
with scRNA-seq data from
[Tabula Muris Senis](https://tabula-muris-senis.ds.czbiohub.org/)
and the
[Murine aging cell atlas](https://mca.research.calicolabs.com/).

All results are available online as a shiny App
[scagecom.org](https://scagecom.org/). The code of the App is available 
[here](https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scAgeComShiny).
